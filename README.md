# Portfolio Project

#### This is a site made by HTML, CSS and Bootstrap

#### Ellyse Carter

## Description
This site is a home page for my portfolio. It has an 'About Me' section, 'My Work' section, 'Contact Me' section, and 'Resume' section. 

The 'My Work' section is separated into 5 section. Only the RunBuddy and Horiseon sections have links to completed projects. The others have stock photos.

The 'Resume' section has links to my Github and my Linkdin. 

In the HTML code, multiple semantics were added, a href links with alt tags, meta tags and bootstrap. Comments were added to identify section headings.

In the stylesheet, comments were added, flex-wraps, hover tags, and media queries were added.
